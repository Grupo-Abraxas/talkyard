CLA v2
---------

Apache 2: https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt
says: *"... prepare derivative works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute
Your Contributions and such derivative works ..."*
so better incl *"and such derivative works"* in Talkyard's CLA too, then?

Other CLA's, e.g. Ghost's, Discourse's, don't include that, so
probably not required? But let's incl, anyway.
