Can admin view direct messages?
Ans: Yes.
If someone for example posts illegal content via direct messages, or spam or toxic messages,
then admins need to be able to investigate.


Rich text editor? Emojis?
Ans: Yes, soon (maybe August 2018). I'm thinking about using ProseMirror. Emojis: will have to wait a bit more. Meanwhile, use `:-)` :- )

How do I do a manual backup?
For the SaaS hosted version: You'll be able to export your community in JSON, see below.
For self hosted version, you can export JSON, and also do a full database backup:
`cd /opt/talkyard ;  .... `

How do I configure automatic backups?
Backups happen daily, for the SaaS hosted version, and also if you install yourself and
follow the instructions (a cron job runs the backup script daily).

Can one export the community in JSON?
Ans: Not yet. There'll be a button that forum owners can click, to export their community
in a `.tar.gz` zip file (?), and therein, there'll be a JSON file with all topics, comments, and users.
Plus all uploaded files, e.g. images.

(Details: Probably one will be able to export a .tar.gz file, which includes a JSON file with all topics & comments & users etcetera, and all uploaded files (images etcetera). I've started a little bit: The end-to-end tests import JSON files to create test communities.)
